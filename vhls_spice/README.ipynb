    "\n",
    "The time domain simulation is based on Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) [^MNA]. MNA itself doesn't support simulate reactive components such as inductors and capcaitors in time domain at the begining. To solve the problem, the reactive componets are modeled as a resistor and a current source connected in parallel. The resistor in the model is constant during the time domain simulation while the current source changes depending on the circuit status from the previous time step. In general, MNA is solving the linear equation:  \n",

    "As discussed before, for reactive components, the value of current source depends on the circuit status of the last time step, namely, $x^{n-1}$. Through adding extra auxilary components (such as zero voltage source, which won't change the operation of the original circuit), it can be assured that corresponding value of the current source can be calculated via $Hx^{n-1}$. Therefore, according to superposition theory, we can partion $z$ into two parts; part 1 $z_0$ that from the human provided sources, such as constant voltage supply; part 2 $z_{re}=Hx$ that from reactive components. Then, the iteration formula becomes:  \n",

When the switch is on, it can be modeled as a small inductor; when it is off, it can be modeled as a small capacitor [^sw]. Via picking proper simulation time step, the status changing between ON and OFF can be simply realied by changing the value of the current source. In this case, $A$ is identical all the time. For each switch, two $H$ matrixes are required, one for on and one for off. Hence, if we use $sw[i]$ to represent the status of $i_{th}$ switch (0 for off, 1 for on), the iteration formula becomes:  \n",
